1.  stdint.h library declare intger types and arrays
2.  TODO
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes.
4.  The first two bytes determine the type of file (bfType) and have values 0x4d42
5.  bfSize is the size of the entire file in bytes, and biSize is the size in bytes header structure
6.  Negative biHeight file that start in the upper left corner
7.  biBitCount
8.  This happens when you can not open the file
9.  This argument sets the number of elements that need to be read
10. The padding would be 3
11. Fseek function moves the pointer position in the stream.
12. Indicates the current position of the file pointer
